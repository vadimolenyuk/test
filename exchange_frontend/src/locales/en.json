			"Text": "<p class='subtitle'>Q:What is an ACH/SEPA Transaction? What are the benefits of ACH/SEPA?</p><p class='content'>An ACH (Automated Clearing House) and SEPA (Smart Electronic Power Alliance) transaction refers to an electronic payment which allows transfer of money from the bank account of one user to the bank account of another user over a secure digital network based on a set of protocols and procedures. Since ACH/SEPA transactions eliminate the need for cash, paper checks, wire, and credit card networks, they are often called direct payments. The ACH/SEPA system is secure, quick and dependable and these attributes has made ACH/SEPA transactions one of the most widely used ways to transfer money.</p><p class='content'>For an ACH/SEPA transaction to work, two banking institutions must be involved â€“ the Originating Depository Financial Institution (ODFI) and the Receiving Depository Financial Institution (RDFI). Basically, ACH/SEPA transactions involve both direct deposits and direct payments and can be used for consumer, government, and B2B transactions. The mechanism behind the ACH/SEPA transaction is simple. Foremost, a sender uses the ACH/SEPA network to initiate a direct payment or direct deposit. The ODFI (the bank of the sender) will send out the ACH/SEPA transaction along with other ACH/SEPA transactions of other bank account holders to the ACH/SEPA operator which is usually a clearing house or the Federal Reserve. The transaction will be processed by the ACH/SEPA operator and made available to the RDFI (the bank of the recipient). Once the transaction has been received by the recipient, the transaction is complete.</p><p class='subtitle'>Q: What are the benefits of the ACH/SEPA transactions?</p><p class='content'><b>The benefits of the ACH/SEPA transactions include:</b></p><p class='content'>Some of the lowest transaction fees for transferring money.</p><p class='content'>Are more secure due to the elimination of multiple processing points.</p><p class='content'>Allow auto invoicing, payment and payment tracking which make the transactions easier.</p><p class='content'>Are more convenient for both the sender and receiver.</p><p class='content'>Save time due to faster processing time.</p><p class='content'>Reduce human errors associated with other types of transaction methods</p><p class='subtitle'>Q: How much is a customer allowed to transact on the exchange? Is there any quantity or monetary restrictions?</p><p class='content'>Our userâ€™s investment limit after initial account activation is set at a maximum of $10,000. However, if you would like to increase your limit, log into your account and select the 'increase my limits' option. The compliance department will request the upload of additional personal documentation and then those documents have to be approved in order to raise the limit to the next level.</p><p class='subtitle'>Q: How many days will it take for customers to receive their digital coin purchase? Can they sell next day?</p><p class='content'>Your digital coin purchases are available to you upon settlement which is typically 3-4 business days, depending on the coin purchased. Once the coin has settled, it can be transferred at your instruction to any wallet you direct it to. Should you wish to sell prior to settlement, simply enter your instruction online and the position will be sold. However, you will have to wait for that transaction to settle before receiving your funds. Generally, the ACH/SEPA processes usually takes places in 3 to 4 days but may take longer depending on your financial institutions.</p><p class='subtitle'>Q: Where can clients access their digital currencies?</p><p class='content'>To access your digital currencies, download the Blockchain Wallet and create a free account.

			"Text": "<p class='title'>What is Cryptocurrency?</p><p class='content'>In order to get the best answer to that question, first, we should ponder another question. What is currency? It's a hard one to answer accurately. Sure, the dictionary answer comes to mind: 'something circulated as a medium of exchange.' But where does money get its value? Is it in comparison to other currencies? Or maybe it's measured against another economic unit like gold? The reality is that no one can firmly answer the question, 'What is Currency?' The attempts at answers get very heady and philosophical. There are numerous points of view.</p><p class='content'>Perhaps the most accurate picture one can have about money is that currency is an economic force of nature no better understood than gravity (which is to say it's understood kinda sorta). And like a force of nature, it's unpredictable. One can predict the actions of currencies about as well as one can predict the weather. We know when a hurricane is coming. The predictability of that nice breeze that comes through your neighborhood now and then is much harder to nail down.</p><p class='title'>Why Do People Buy and Use Cryptocurrency?</p><p class='content'> Consider the following proposition: Cryptocurrency has all of the good stuff that currency has, and replaces the bad stuff with better options.</p><p class='title'>So what is this good stuff?</p><p class='content'> A good currency needs four properties in the right proportions in order to be a success - things like it can't be so small it easily gets lost or so big it's awkward to carry around. It also has to be somewhat rare. If the 'mix' of properties is right then people will want to use the currency.</p><p class='content'> Currency's first property is uniqueness. It must be an easily identifiable object distinct from every other object. Take gold for example. It is an element that can be verified and the object itself is stable. An ounce of gold has the same number of gold molecules anywhere in the world (and probably the universe but I'm not going to divert into strange physics here). Simply stated, gold is gold.</p><p class='content'> Currency's second property is its rarity. But it's a certain type of rarity - rare, but not too rare. Fiat currencies are convenient in this sense in that the money supply can be manipulated and thus the rarity of the currency can be controlled. However, lessons in the ways this can backfire could fill another website.</p><p class='content'> Gold is an element that lives in a Goldilocks zone of rarity, and that has made it a preferred currency for centuries. It's found at regular intervals but its rarity projects a sense of the finite. 'At some point,' says the financial wizard in our imaginations, 'we will run out of gold.' True or not, a currency needs at least a sense of the finite. A known finite quantity is probably better than an unknown (but expected) finite quantity, but again, we really don't want to get too weird here.</p><p class='content'> The third property of a desirable currency is its portability. Here is where gold falls down. It's heavy. For the better part of history, those carrying gold found it difficult to outrun those not carrying gold. This is where a paper currency had an advantage. It was lighter and more safely transferable.</p><p class='content'> The fourth property of a currency is the core perception that it has value. People have to want it. While there are elements rarer than gold and just as stable, they don't have the reputation of gold. A child grows up understanding that their family's gold jewelry is special. Almost universally, children receive consistent verbal and non-verbal cues from an early age that gold is something special.</p><p class='title'>So How Does Cryptocurrency Improve Upon Traditional Currency?</p><p class='content'> Cryptocurrency has all our properties that a currency needs to compete in the marketplace. It is unique and more readily verifiable as real or not than traditional currency. The rough total possible number of 'coins' in a cryptocurrency is generally known. So while rarity will depend on desirability for something like Bitcoin, its rarity when compared with demand is undeniable no matter how it performed in the market this year. That a virtual coin would be worth over $100 much less several thousand in 2018 got lots of laughs in 2008.</p><p class='content'> Since cryptocurrencies coins exist as digital bits of data, they can be transferred anywhere in the world in a short period of time. Several cryptocurrency options are being investigated as possible disruptions to international banking transfers, making transfers between countries happen in minutes instead of the current systems which can take days or longer.</p><p class='content'> Core perception of value in cryptocurrency is growing even as specific currencies like Bitcoin take poundings in the press as an example of a 'bubble' and economic fad. At the same time, the blockchain technology that is used to make cryptocurrencies is being touted as a solution to everything from medical care records to mean people on social media. While perceptions of specific currencies may ebb and flow, the perception of cryptocurrency technology is that it is as revolutionary to the next twenty -five years as the Internet has been to the last.</p><p class='title'>So What's The Great Thing Cryptocurrency Has That Traditional Currency Doesn't?</p><p class='content'> Encryption.</p><p class='content'> Currently, the rules for using a currency are set by those who print it. The U.S. Government sets regulations for what identification is necessary to open a bank account. They set deposit thresholds where banks must report deposits in excess of the threshold amount. They attempt to track large cash payments for luxury items.</p><p class='content'> The rules for using a cryptocurrency are defined by the community using the currency. Different coins have different levels of encryption, transparency, and control. Ultimately the marketplace defines how a cryptocurrency tracks transactions, at least where governments are leaving the marketplace alone.</p>",
